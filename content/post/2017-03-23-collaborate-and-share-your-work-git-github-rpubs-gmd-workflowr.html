<h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
<p>Git was originally invented by Linus Torvalds (also a founder of linux). It changed the way open software is developed. For example, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow">Tensorflow</a> project (deep learning software backed by Google) has &gt;700 contributors and most of them are not Google employees (source: Tensorflow Dev Summit, February 2017).</p>
<p>We will be using a tiny fraction of git/GitHub functionality to collaborate and share our work. Read <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html">Chapter 1</a> in Jenny Brian’s <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/">Happy Git and GitHub for the useR</a>.</p>
<p>If you got lost, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/happy-git-and-gihub-for-the-user-tutorial/">her tutorial</a> at rstudio::conf might help.</p>
